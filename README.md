# twitter-like-app :coffee: :sunglasses:

This is a simple twitter-like (REST service microblogging) in some languages.

NOT a big deal, its just a study-case repository, feel free to play around. :metal:

### About the source code
> To this 'crude option', I choose to use a 'php boilerplate' buid for my own purpuses.
>
> The code I using here is a copy of a own project outdated and is dated with date of july, 2013;
>
> This code is based and a small improvement of project "[caffeineengine](https://github.com/chroda/caffeineengine)" in my github,
> the first commit is dated in Apr 23, 2012, so its a very old code.
>
> But, to be a "php pure" application, I guess its okay;
